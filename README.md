# Introduction
This was an idea I had earlier this year. Someone posted this [very useful link](https://t.co/KKSrhEAnrD?amp=1) earlier, which made me think that maybe I ought to restart thinking about this, it could be quite a fun learning process. 


There is an old readability formula, and I just wanted to see if I could implement it in python. The challenge will be that all I know of python is the basic Codecademy course.
